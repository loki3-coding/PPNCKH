What
    ResNet50 + sigmoid + no freeze
    + overstampling
    Dataset www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
When
    7h42

Why
    ResNet50 is simple for training
    if we want to use anotherNet, just write one line 
How
    ResNet50
        same
    Add sigmoid lastlayer
        binary classification
     LEARING_RATE = 0.001
        same
    LEARNING_RATE_SCHEDULE_FACTOR = 0.1 
        same
    LEARNING_RATE_SCHEDULE_PATIENCE = 5 
        Just begining
    Label 1 = Label 0
        use overstampling
Result
    Train1:
        Acc = 0.7353479853479854 (with threshold = 0.5)
        Acc = 0.7765567765567766 (with threshold = 0.75)
        Acc = 0.826007326007326 (with threshold =  0.95)
        Acc = 0.6428571428571429 (with threshold = 1, 2, 3) ???? 
Comment
    :( it's my mistake
    Just training dataset is imbalance, but I write overstampling (
    label0 * 3) running in DataFudusdataset => validation dataset and 
    test dataset is change (which valid_dataset is balance so after changing, 
    valid score nerver go down in figue)
    So, acc is higher when threshold come to 1.

    * maxepoch = 100 -> training dataset * 2 time
