What
    ResNet 101 + freeze + overstampling
When

How
    ResNet101
        ResNet50 has good score
    freeze params
        freeze params get better score than unfreeze 
        Because dataset is not large
    overstampling
        label0 * 3 = label1
    Count params = 42 502 209
Result
    Acc = 0.9262820512820513 (threshold = 0.5 perfect)
Comment
    the figue illustrates that score is so perfect => can't learning anything after 1/4 dataset.
    We need a better loss function and optimize.
    Time for training is 5h < 8h - deadline of Kaggle, but it give an attention.
    The next Net is EfficientNet - Best ConvNet in this time.
