What 
    EfficientNet B2 + NoFreeze + BCEWithLogitsLoss 
When
    20h58
    22/07/2019
Why
    After Method06, more problem appear:
    Time for training
    LossFunc
    Better Model
How
    EfficientNet B2
        This's the best.
        cannot use B1,2,3,... because of 'CUDA out of memory'
    NoFreeze
        Just Trying
    BCEWithLogitsLoss
        Not only reduce dataset - time for training 
        But also solve problem which dataset is very imbalance.
        Set pos_w = 0.346 because neigative / positive = 0.346
Result
    Acc = 0.9278846153846154
