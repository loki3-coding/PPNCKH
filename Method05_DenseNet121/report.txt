What
    DenseNet121 + sigmoid + freeze
    + overstampling
    Dataset www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
When
    19h42
    21/09/2019
Why
    Update network
    if we want to use anotherNet, just write one line 
How
    overstampling
        dataset is imbalance in train_dataset
    DenseNet121
        and we can compare with ResNet50
    Add sigmoid lastlayer
        binary classification
    freeze
        because freeze give better score (method03 vs method02)
    LEARING_RATE = 0.001

    LEARNING_RATE_SCHEDULE_FACTOR = 0.1 

    LEARNING_RATE_SCHEDULE_PATIENCE = 5 

Result
    Train 1: Acc = 0.9022435897435898 (threshold = 0.95)
    Train 2: Acc = 0.8830128205128205 (threshold = 0.95)
Comment
    It's wrong when I test with DenseNet121. It very slow :(((((
    Apromximate ResNet50 with freeze (but this model has more layer - 121 vs 50)
