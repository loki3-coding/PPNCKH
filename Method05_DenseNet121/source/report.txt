What
    DenseNet121 + sigmoid + freeze
    + overstampling
    Dataset www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
When
    10h42
    21/09/2019
Why
    Update network
    if we want to use anotherNet, just write one line 
How
    DenseNet121
        and we can compare with ResNet50
    Add sigmoid lastlayer
        binary classification
    freeze
        because freeze give better score (method03 vs method02)
    LEARING_RATE = 0.001
        same
    LEARNING_RATE_SCHEDULE_FACTOR = 0.1 
        same
    LEARNING_RATE_SCHEDULE_PATIENCE = 5 
        same
    Label 1 = Label 0
        use overstampling
    maxepoch * batch_size = train_dataset.imgs.count()
        Reduce time for training
