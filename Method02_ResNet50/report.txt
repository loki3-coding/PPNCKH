What
    Use ResNet 50 + sigmoid lastlayer + freeze model
    Dataset www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
When
    17h00
    20/09/2019
Why 
    The first experiment in this dataset
How 
    ResNet50
        Begin with simple model
    Add sigmoid at lastlayer
        Because we just detect 1-pneumonia - 0-otherwise
    Freeze all layer except fully connected layer
        Because dataset just has <= 6000 pic for training
    LEARNING_RATE = 0.001
        Just begining
    LEARNING_RATE_SCHEDULE_FACTOR = 0.1 
        Just begining
    LEARNING_RATE_SCHEDULE_PATIENCE = 5 
        Just begining
    Label 1 = 3 * Label 0
        it's dataset
Result 
    Acc =  0.8942307692307693
    Time aproximate 2h
Comment 
    Score's so low because we have lots of data but freeze model (except lastlayer)
    LEARNING_RATE's also low making loss variable reduce slowly
    Model is ResNet50. It's so fast for training (because there param used is smaller than another model 
    such as DenseNet or CheXNet). We will able to use it for trying config some params
    This is the dataset we need because of time for training, comparing with CheXNet
