What
    efficientNet B0 + overstampling + BCEWithLogitLoss + no freeze
    Kaggle deny me =((((
When
    23h00
    22/07/2019
Why
    I want to improve accuracy with overstampling + BCEWithLogitLoss
    Because dataset with overstampling is >= 12 000 image so I think that nofreeze is better.
How 
    BCEWithLogitLoss
        This version is more numerically stable than using a plain Sigmoid followed by a BCELoss.
        Can solve imbalance problem and give better LossFunc
Result
    Train1:
        Acc = 0.865384615
Comment
    Disapointed =(((
    But wait, why training stop after 1/5 dataset ??? I need to train again
