Why 
    For deadline PPNCKH 
How
    Use DenseNet121 + pretrained = True
        better than resNet50 (in baseline model)
Result
    Acc = 0.85047 > 0.77 (Restnet50 baseline)
Comment DEFEAT
    In medicine image, DenseNet121 is better than resNet50 (baseline)
    But this is a defeat because we don't have a strong model for comparing or are able to use their Dataset
    We need another Dataset for another problems
