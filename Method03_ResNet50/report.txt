What 
    ResNet 50 + sigmoid lastlayer + no freeze

Why
    Comparing with freezing all params method02
How
    ResNet 50
        use the same model
    Add sigmoid at lastlayer
        Because we just detect 1-pneumonia - 0-otherwise
    LEARING_RATE = 0.001
        same
    LEARNING_RATE_SCHEDULE_FACTOR = 0.1 
        same
    LEARNING_RATE_SCHEDULE_PATIENCE = 5 
        Just begining
    Label 1 = 3 * Label 0
        it's dataset
Result 
    Train1
        Acc = 0.8105  (with thresh hold = 0.5)
    Train2:
        Acc = 0.7548076923076923 (threshold = 0.7)
Comment
    The figue illustriates that loss_variable is very small. It's hard to reduce it while 
    Acc could be better.
    We need another optimaze and loss, and training in the new way.
    maxepoch = 100 -> training dataset * 2. 
    We need reduce the time for training (2h at this time)
