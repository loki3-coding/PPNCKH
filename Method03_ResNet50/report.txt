What 
    ResNet 50 + sigmoid lastlayer + no freeze
    Dataset www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
When 
    21h30
    20/09/2019
Why
    Comparing with the first method
How
    ResNet 50
        use the same model
    Add sigmoid at lastlayer
        Because we just detect 1-pneumonia - 0-otherwise
    LEARING_RATE = 0.001
        same
    LEARNING_RATE_SCHEDULE_FACTOR = 0.1 
        same
    LEARNING_RATE_SCHEDULE_PATIENCE = 5 
        Just begining
    Label 1 = 3 * Label 0
        it's dataset
Result 
    Acc =
